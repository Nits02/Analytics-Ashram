## üåç Business & Societal Challenges

1. **Climate Vulnerability in Urban Regions**
   - Singapore faces increasing exposure to extreme weather events like heatwaves, thunderstorms, and flash floods due to climate change.
   - Vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, low-income households) are disproportionately impacted by such events, especially in underserved neighborhoods.

2. **Lack of Real-Time Risk Awareness**
   - Urban populations lack access to localized, real-time insights on climate risks and preparedness measures.
   - Public agencies need better tools to target emergency interventions and optimize resource deployment.

3. **Fragmented View of Resilience**
   - Existing data on weather, health infrastructure, social determinants of health (SDOH), and emergency resources is scattered and difficult to act upon collectively.
   - There is a need for a unified framework that combines environmental, infrastructural, and demographic factors.

## üß† Technical Challenges

1. **Data Integration Across Disparate Sources**
   - Aggregating and harmonizing data from AccuWeather, PredictHQ, and Singapore‚Äôs Open Data APIs involves handling multiple formats (CSV, API, JSON), varying schemas, and update frequencies.

2. **Real-Time & Predictive Indexing**
   - Computing a **Disaster Resilience and Preparedness Index (DRPI)** requires scalable, low-latency pipelines that transform raw geospatial + SDOH + event risk data into actionable insights.

3. **AI Modeling in a Context-Aware Way**
   - The DRPI model must account for domain-specific attributes like heat index severity, forecast uncertainty, neighborhood infrastructure, healthcare proximity, and socio-economic vulnerability.

4. **Visualization & Human-Centric Interaction**
   - Building AI/BI dashboards that are intuitive, real-time, and interactive for a variety of stakeholders (residents, city planners, emergency services).
   - Enabling **Genie Spaces** to allow conversational data exploration in natural language.

5. **Governance, Security & Reusability**
   - Ensuring data governance, traceability, and reusability through **Databricks Unity Catalog** and secure Delta Lake architecture.
   - Enabling seamless integration across **Databricks Apps**, alerting, and workflows.
